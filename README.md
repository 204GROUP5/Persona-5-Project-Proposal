# CISC/CMPE 204 Modelling Project

Welcome to the major project for CISC/CMPE 204 (Fall 2021)!

This project models the game of Persona 5. It will take a number of opponents between 1 to 5, and assign all a power weakness and a resistance. The model will then "battle" the opponents with 4 teammates, each with their own power type. It will try and solve the program/win the battle as quickly as possible. For a detaied view at our project description  https://1drv.ms/p/s!AlWMkaQIZRPntW_hyaJafsUPLTsc .

## Structure

* `documents`: Contains folders for both of your draft and final submissions. README.md files are included in both.
* `run.py`: General wrapper script that you can choose to use or not. Only requirement is that you implement the one function inside of there for the auto-checks.
* `test.py`: Run this file to confirm that your submission has everything required. This essentially just means it will check for the right files and sufficient theory size.
